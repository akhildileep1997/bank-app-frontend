   11 Reactive Forms:_
        Reactive forms provide a model-driven approach to handling form inputs whose values change over time.
        Reactive forms are built around observable streams, where form inputs and values are provided as streams
        of input values, which can be accessed synchronously.
        => go to app.module.ts
                       import { ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

                        @NgModule({
                        imports: [
                        // other imports ...
                        ReactiveFormsModule
                                 ],
                             })
                         export class AppModule { }

         ->     FormGroup create in ts
         ->     FormArray  create in ts
         ->     FormControl      create in html page    

             FormBuilder:-
                 The FormBuilder provides syntactic sugar that shortens creating instances of a FormControl, 
                 FormGroup, or FormArray.
                 It reduces the amount of boilerplate needed to build complex forms.  
             FormGroup:-
                 Constructs a new FormGroup instance. Accepts a single generic argument,
                  which is an object containing all the keys and corresponding inner control types.
